# Decision-Tree

implement a decision tree classifier using the wine dataset, start by loading the dataset, which contains 178 samples with 13 chemical properties as features and three wine cultivars as target classes. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Train the decision tree classifier on the training data, where the model learns to make splits at each node based on features that maximize information gain. After training, predict the wine classes for the testing set and assess the model's accuracy. Use a confusion matrix and classification report to understand detailed performance metrics. Visualize the decision tree to interpret how the features influence the classification of the wine samples.
